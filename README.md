# MauriUtils

This helper library includes some of the most basic and used commonly written features in everyday Swift development such as:

- `JSON/PlistDecodable`: structs that handle JSON's decoding data (_Decodable_ compliant models). Worry only about passing in its Type and decoding strategy (only if you wish to for the later one, otherwise a `.default` will be implemented for you)

- `FileReader`: read locally stored files within your project or inside the app's bundle with handy `struct`.

- Several `Array/Sequence` helper methods such as `.generateRandomElements(arraySize: Int)`, `.average`, `numberOfOccurrences(of inputTarget: Element)` and more!

Feel free to submit your pull requests and I'll happily check them. Thanks!
